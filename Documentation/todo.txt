- define if-then-else
- allow affects all/any (env / entity) - code gen correct
- globals = model parameters - gen correct code
- move UDA out of general entity
- correct code generation for MARG
- remove center on patch and do it auto after move
- wolf sheep scheduling - correct code gen ref Library
- make partner in Interaction an EntityReference
- generate agent condition at call, not at proc. call is correct if parent applicable to same
- better structure for read and write other and network
- 3 scenarios for Bullying = 3 experiments, intvalue -> repetitions
- init: add init concept -> init -> experiment
- endcondition, move to simulation / experiment
- move init entity state -> entity state (editor)
- fix code Wolf Sheep, Voting, Fire, FireAgents, Segregation cf. Library
- why is occupied an interaction in segregation? fix it.
