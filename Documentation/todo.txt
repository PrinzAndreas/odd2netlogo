TODO list for development of ODD2Netlogo
- use rangeType for regrow-grass (wolf sheep)
- make wolf-sheep work when eat-grass refers to environment grass
- make rationales a separate concepts and move out of UDA and entity
- make stochasticity an extra concept and move out of UDA and others
- remove name4entity (UDA) editors
- do not create / remove initattributes of entities within entities and states (they appear now twice)
- disallow changing names outside the definition
- use multiline for model description and all places where the line gets too long
- make <ctrl>-B work correctly for all kinds of concepts (also when looking at errors etc.)
- recreate wolf-sheep and fix UI on the way
- Editor should consistently say "Press enter to create new entity" for all collections
- Editor should consistently say "Press ctrl-space to select" for all selections (e.g. expression)
- use UI from IVR for ODD: check boxes (lang.editor.forms), use folding true (video3 of Vaclav)
- manual experiments should work without adding automatic experiments
- maybe use a direct reference to UDA instead of AttributeAccess for better context menu
- fix code Voting cf. Library
- fix code Fire cf. Library
- fix code FireAgents cf. Library
- fix code Segregation cf. Library (why is occupied an interaction)
- copy documentation 2019 and earlier into git: papers, reports 445, ...
- fix warnings (19) and infos (2)
- allow define with the same name within different functions
- remove boolean expressions and call them characterizations
- recreate MARG and fix UI on the way
- Improve and introduce (synthetic) characterizations (boolean).
- improve context menu for MARG for normal activities
- The rationale for Initialization does not need the rationale choice (Established theory etc).
- calculate should be done in go, not in plot
- add random uniform stochasticity editor
- use expressions for plots, improve plot: name for plot and name for y-axis, allow colours to be defined for plot
- define function parameters as entities (not types), sort parameters of functions
- should sliders be expressions?
- allow let in conditional
- use reference for presentation item (data presentation)
- remove arrays? - not needed (move to future use)
- remove styling hintIfNull?
- styling hint versus comment? should they be selectable?
- make good stylings for sections and user input and definitions and hints and comments
- recheck all constraints
- timed condition does not need comparison operator
- improve codegen for element-wise
- do not have text as selectable
- use textgen base components in order to simplify textgen
- make dataCollection and presentation more uniform
- clean CountEntities and Collect
- Categorical should refer to the category collection (enumeration).
- typing of expressions
- move [stop] out of generation for end condition
- improve folding
- indent in spawn is missing - spawn should also better be called "clone"
- Fix the editor for simulation end.
- Beautify structure class diagrams
- Make desccription from UDA into IDescribedConcept

TODO for Martin
- use base styles consistently in editor
  - user input formal: underlined (COMPLETED: style userInput)
  - user input informal: grey text (COMPLETED: style: userInputInformal)
  - name definition: colour and bold
  - name use: colour
  - tool text: plain (COMPLETED: style toolText)
  - tool instructions: light grey and italics (COMPLETED: style toolInstructions (former hint))
  - we do not use keywords. (COMPLETED: removed 8/11)
- ensure that folders in the editor and other aspects to match folders in structure
- introduce proper constraints for names
  - constraints for names: Identifiers may contain any Unicode letter or digit and the following ASCII characters: .?=*!<>:#+/%$_^'&-
  - constraints that names cannot be the NetLogo keywords - maybe define this constraint related to INamedConcept
- sort between github and tools.uia version and remove the tools.uia version
- Make boxes (eg add new entity) visible in all cases.
- Create boxes for activities

TODO Student project
- create user instructions for activities
- localize codegen
- ensure that the cursor goes to where the specification should be inputted
- Editor – fix the cursor issue  make the cursor go to the spaces
- Editor- create some decriptions (the ones that are not already there)
- Create instructions for editor in Synthetic Attributes
- When we create something it is automatically given a name- unnamed action, unnamed entity, remove the option unnamed. Also there should be the instruction insert name here in all possible locations and not only in 1 or 2 . So we should not see no name
- Constraints- constrain options in the context menu
- Constrain- color can only be used for 1 type of entity (either entity or environment entity)
- Introduce unit test

TODO later and larger
- create predefined UDAs shape, size, colour
- use kernelF for expressions
- implement Status Arena ODD in the tool
- streamline scoping using super and ODD scopes
- make all errors in textgen to real errors (see ElementWise), and insert constraints that avoid them
- run netlogo from MPS
- Import the jetbrains.mps.lang.editor.tooltips language and insert the "tooltip" cell. This lets you specify a cell to put into the editor (perhaps an icon) and a tooltip to show, when the mouse hovers over the cell.
- show init shared attributes in the entities (for each of them)
- sort out concepts in hierarchy of EntityReference
- fix install on Mac and Linux, maybe create only a plugin? following are the steps for Mac
  1. Install OpenJDK 14 from https://jdk.java.net/14/ by extracting the .tar.gz into a folder like /usr/local (or somewhere else you can access)
  2. From the terminal, cd to /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines
  3. (Well, it’s only for experts, but…) ln -s /usr/local/jdk-14.0.2.jdk
  3. (I mean) sudo ln -s /usr/local/jdk-14.0.2.jdk
  4. cd /Applications/odd2netlogo\ 1.0.app/Contents
  5. edit Info.plist — on line 93, change 10* to 14*
  6. cd MacOS
  7. ./odd2netlogo
  7. It also seems to work when you click the icon
- create plugin and not standalone
- bundle file printing with release: com.mbeddr.mpsutil.uisupport
- allow comments in the code (see ACT ONE)
- make nice logos and images
- create NetLogo in MPS?
