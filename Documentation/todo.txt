TODO list for development of ODD2Netlogo
- wolf sheep scheduling - correct code gen ref Library
- recheck MARG generated code
- fix code Voting, Fire, FireAgents, Segregation cf. Library
- why is occupied an interaction in segregation? fix it.
- generate agent condition at call, not at proc. call is correct if parent applicable to same
- init: add init concept -> init -> experiment
- endcondition, move to simulation / experiment
- move init entity state -> entity state (editor)
- disallow changing names outside the definition
- check all concepts with TODO
- define function parameters as entities (not types), sort parameters of functions
- should sliders be expressions?
- use reference for presentation item (data presentation)
- remove arrays? - not needed (move to future use)
- allow comments in the code (see ACT ONE)
- remove styling hintIfNull?
- improve appearance of MARG
- styling hint versus comment? should they be selectable?
- make good stylings for sections and user input and definitions and hints and comments
- recheck all constraints
- improve codegen for element-wise
- put make actions and functions into the same category
- do not have text as selectable
- The rationale for Initialization does not need the rationale choice (Established theory etc).
- The rationales that get adhoc rules probably do not need further explanation. When I was filling these rationales, I thought it was similar to describing the rationale topic.
- I do not think we need the rationales for Interaction and Stochasticity.
- avoid showing the rationales that are not filled
- use textgen base components in order to simplify textgen
- make dataCollection more uniform
- make <ctrl>-B work correctly for all kinds of concepts (also when looking at errors etc.)
- recreate MARG and fix UI on the way
- Editor should consistently say "Press enter to create new entity" for all collections
- Editor should consistently say "Press ctrl-space to select" for all selections (e.g. expression)
- improve context menu for MARG for normal activities
- build stand-alone
- maybe use a direct reference to UDA instead of AttributeAccess for better context menu
- context menu for expressions

TODO for Martin
- make editor for expressions
- create user instructions and insert option list in the scheduling and the procedure editor
- ensure that the cursor does not go to titles of sections and subsections but goes to where the specification should be inputted (Made Titles nonselectable, but cursor placement is not addressed)
- ensure that when the user creates something, she needs to press ENTER and when she selects an option for an existing specification , she needs to press control and space
- proper indent in editor (see condionalAction)
- recreate MARG and fix UI on the way
- use base styles consistently in editor
- adjust virtual packages for editor and other aspects to match packages in structure
- copy documentation 2019 and earlier into git: papers, reports 445, ...
- good editor for optional parts: boolean attributes - should have a text for present and another text for not present
- constraints that names cannot be the same, maybe related to INamedConcept: All primitives, global and agent variable names, and procedure names share a single global case-insensitive namespace; local names (let variables and the names of procedure inputs) may not shadow global names or each other. Identifiers may contain any Unicode letter or digit and the following ASCII characters: .?=*!<>:#+/%$_^'&-
- constraints that names cannot be the NetLogo keywords - maybe define this constraint related to INamedConcept
- localize codegen
- introduce proper constraints for names
- typing of expressions
- move [stop] out of generation for end condition
- sort between github and tools.uia version and remove the tools.uia version
- fix selection of agent and UI generally
- fix focus (init vs. entities)
- make names (and other properties) showing in multiple places R/O model access. (Tried, but introduces more problems than it solves, as focus is redirected to a read-only cell)

TODO later and larger
- create predefined UDAs shape, size, colour
- make sections of ODD collapsable
- use kernelF for expressions
- implement Status Arena ODD in the tool
- streamline scoping using super and ODD scopes
- make all errors in textgen to real errors (see ElementWise), and insert constraints that avoid them
