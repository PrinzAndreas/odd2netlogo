TODO list for development of ODD2Netlogo
- codegen filter
- codegen collect
- correct code generation for MARG: positive-interaction(filter, collect), free-interaction, learn-about, ...
- 3 scenarios for MARG = 3 experiments, intvalue -> repetitions
- define function parameters as entities (not types)
- allow affects all/any (env / entity) - code gen correct
- make partner in Interaction an EntityReference
- remove center on patch and do it auto after move
- wolf sheep scheduling - correct code gen ref Library
- generate agent condition at call, not at proc. call is correct if parent applicable to same
- better structure for read and write other and network
- init: add init concept -> init -> experiment
- endcondition, move to simulation / experiment
- move init entity state -> entity state (editor)
- fix code Wolf Sheep, Voting, Fire, FireAgents, Segregation cf. Library
- why is occupied an interaction in segregation? fix it.
- improve appearance of MARG
- check all concepts with TODO
- should sliders be expressions?
- remove arrays? - not needed (move to future use)
- remove styling hintIfNull?
- make good stylings for sections and user input and definitions and hints and comments
- recheck all constraints
- make all errors in textgen to real errors (see ElementWise), and insert constraints that avoid them

TODO later
- create predefined UDAs shape, size, colour

TODO for Martin
2. create editor for rationale
3. differentiate between user input text and template text (font, colour, ...)
4. make boxes around the proper syntactic entities (actions, interactions)
5. make adding of interactions possible in UI
- experiments editor
- fix editors (references)
- proper indent in editor (see condionalAction)
- recreate MARG and fix UI on the way
- go to new version of MPS
- use base styles consistently in editor
- adjust virtual packages for editor and other aspects to match packages in structure
- copy documentation 2019 and earlier into git: papers, reports 445, ...
- good editor for optional parts: boolean attributes - should have a text for present and another text for not present
- constraints that names cannot be the same
- localize codegen
- remove unused nameforentity editors
- better editor display for increment, decrement, set
- editor input for attribute access of other
- do not allow attribute of other for actions
- introduce proper constraints for names
- typing of expressions
- remove branches from github
- move [stop] out of generation for end condition
- sort between github and tools.uia version and remove the tools.uia version
- build stand-alone
- make all generated code work
- fix selection of agent and UI generally
- fix focus (init vs. entities)
- use kernelF for expressions
- create code for behavioural space
