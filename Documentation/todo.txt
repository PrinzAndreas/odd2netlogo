TODO list for development of ODD2Netlogo
- 2 scenarios for MARG = 2 experiments, intvalue -> repetitions
- define function parameters as entities (not types), sort parameters of functions
- allow affects all/any (env / entity) - code gen correct
- make partner in Interaction an EntityReference
- remove center on patch and do it auto after move
- wolf sheep scheduling - correct code gen ref Library
- generate agent condition at call, not at proc. call is correct if parent applicable to same
- better structure for read and write other and network
- init: add init concept -> init -> experiment
- endcondition, move to simulation / experiment
- move init entity state -> entity state (editor)
- fix code Wolf Sheep, Voting, Fire, FireAgents, Segregation cf. Library
- why is occupied an interaction in segregation? fix it.
- improve appearance of MARG
- check all concepts with TODO
- should sliders be expressions?
- remove arrays? - not needed (move to future use)
- remove styling hintIfNull?
- make good stylings for sections and user input and definitions and hints and comments
- recheck all constraints
- make all errors in textgen to real errors (see ElementWise), and insert constraints that avoid them
- improve codegen for element-wise
- fill netlogo info

TODO later
- create predefined UDAs shape, size, colour

TODO for Martin
2. create editor for rationale (fix the rationale editor for Prediction, Scales and Emergence)
3. make editor for expressions
4. differentiate between user input text and template text (font, colour, ...)
- make boxes around the proper syntactic entities (actions, interactions)
5. make adding of interactions possible in UI
- create user instructions and insert option list in the scheduling and the procedure editor
- make sure that an action specification can be deleted
- experiments editor
- ensure that the cursor does not go to titles of sections and subsections but goes to where the specification should be inputted
- ensure that when the user creates something , she needs to press ENTER and when she selects an option for an existing specification , she needs to press control and space
- fix editors (references)
- proper indent in editor (see condionalAction)
- recreate MARG and fix UI on the way
- go to new version of MPS
- use base styles consistently in editor
- adjust virtual packages for editor and other aspects to match packages in structure
- copy documentation 2019 and earlier into git: papers, reports 445, ...
- good editor for optional parts: boolean attributes - should have a text for present and another text for not present
- constraints that names cannot be the same, maybe related to INamedConcept: All primitives, global and agent variable names, and procedure names share a single global case-insensitive namespace; local names (let variables and the names of procedure inputs) may not shadow global names or each other. Identifiers may contain any Unicode letter or digit and the following ASCII characters: .?=*!<>:#+/%$_^'&-
- constraints that names cannot be the NetLogo keywords - maybe define this constraint related to INamedConcept
- localize codegen
- remove unused nameforentity editors
- better editor display for increment, decrement, set
- editor input for attribute access of other
- do not allow attribute of other for actions
- introduce proper constraints for names
- typing of expressions
- remove branches from github
- move [stop] out of generation for end condition
- sort between github and tools.uia version and remove the tools.uia version
- build stand-alone
- make all generated code work
- fix selection of agent and UI generally
- fix focus (init vs. entities)
- use kernelF for expressions
- create code for behavioural space
